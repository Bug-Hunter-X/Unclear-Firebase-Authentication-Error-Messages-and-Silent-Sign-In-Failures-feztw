# Firebase Authentication Error Handling Improvements

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication error handling: unclear error messages and insufficient feedback from silent sign-in attempts.

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how generic errors can make debugging challenging. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides improved error handling with more descriptive messages and better handling of silent sign-in failures.  This enhances the user experience and simplifies troubleshooting.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure Firebase in `firebaseBug.js` and `firebaseBugSolution.js` with your project's credentials.
4. Run the scripts and observe the error handling differences.
