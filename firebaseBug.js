The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email or password is incorrect, or if there's a network issue during authentication.  The error messages aren't always clear, making debugging difficult.  For instance, a generic 'auth/network-request-failed' doesn't pinpoint the exact problem, whether it's connectivity, server-side issues, or an incorrect credential.  Another issue involves the silent authentication flow. If it fails, it might not provide sufficient information on why the silent sign-in attempt failed.
